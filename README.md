## Hi there 

I'm Lili a current Master's student at the University of Sheffield, studying Data Science. I am currently working on projects using R Studio and it's various packages, some of which are available 
on my profile. I am working towards a disseration based around the ethics of data science and collection, and how poor quality data can affect our findings. 

Over the course of the next few months I hope to work on some of the skills I already have, whilst also learning some more, and eventually apply this to some post-graduate work. I have had multiple jobs 
in the past with varying levels of responsibility, which have allowed me to develop professional skills such as time management, prioritisation, leadership, note-taking and more, and I look forward to 
the opportunity to combine these with academic skills one day. 

Thanks
